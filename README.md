(This game project is based on the general concept of catching falling objects, 
inspired by a game I saw in a video. While the theme and assets are my own, 
I used that core mechanic as a reference. To complete this project, I also used AI tools 
as a guide — especially for organizing the code, resolving bugs, and understanding object-oriented design principles.)
